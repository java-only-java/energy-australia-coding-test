1. Run the maven build by going into the root directory and running "mvn clean install"

2. This is a SpringBoot application. Run the Application by typing in "mvn spring-boot:run". This will run the Spring boot app at port 8080. 

3. Since, I have attached the debugger in the configuration better run this application  as:
   mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"
   
4. Import the project in eclipse. Attach the remote debugger from within eclipse by going to Run -> Debug Configurations -> Remote Java Application, and select new launch configuration.

5. Make sure select host as localhost and port as 5005 (The debug port configured as above).  Then click "Debug" button.

6. Now go to the browser and enter http://localhost:8080/api/v1/eamusicfestivals. The response required will be printed on the screen as well on the terminal server screen console.

7. Integration Test has been added. They can also be run from within eclipse too by going to the Integration test class MusicFestivalDataRestAPIControllerIntegrationTest
   and runnnig it as Run as Junit Test. Or it can be run as "mvn clean test". The output will be printed on the console.
